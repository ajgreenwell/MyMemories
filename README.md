# My Memories –– A Custom Alexa Skill

This application is intended to function as a voice-activated memory bank that can be navigated using simple voice commands, such as "Alexa, tell my memories to play", or "Alexa, fast forward by 5 memories". The voice UI is implemented using JSON and is contained within the dialoguemodel.json file. All backend code is stored within index.js. 

I developed this Alexa skill in the summer of 2018 as a birthday gift for my girlfriend, particularly as a way to help us both get through the inevitable months of long-distance that college life entails. I authored roughly 100 memories that she play back to remind her of our time together. For privacy purposes, those memories have been removed from the code, but the empty objects that contained them have been left behind. 

This skill is not yet available on Amazon's public skill market, though it is currently in beta phase and could be commericalized in the coming months.
